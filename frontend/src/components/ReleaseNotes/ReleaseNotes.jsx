                    <p>Our tech stack was decided upon by a group preference. This is our final selection.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Frontend-React:</b> React is our frontend due to our team already having experience and it being a standard in todayâ€™s web.</li>
                        <li><b>Backend-Flask:</b> Flask is our backend due to our team being very familiar with python and Flask has very good documentation.</li>
                        <li><b>Database-MySQL:</b> MySQL is easy to setup, works well with almost every package and has good scalability for further upgrades.</li>
                        <li><b>Authentication-Self Hosted:</b> As a team we decided to host our own authentication holding our sessions and never hosting a plain text password.</li>
                        <li><b>Testing-Jest&PyTest:</b> We used two libraries for testing Jest for frontend and PyTest for backend, mostly due to personal preference.</li>
